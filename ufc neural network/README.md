The Ultimate Fighting Championship is the foremost Mixed Martial Arts promoter. 

Here, I have built a neural network that uses past statistics to predict the outcome of MMA Matches in the UFC with 70% accuracy.

Neural network developed with "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python" book. 

Reads in processed data from the accompanied .csv file before using a deep neural network with 256 nodes and 2 hidden layers.

Variables that can be changed:

- Arguments of the Optimiser_RMSprop function.
  
- unseen_up2: The most recent number of fights you want to test your neural network on.

The preprocessed_data.csv file comes from rezan21's github page: https://github.com/rezan21/UFC-Prediction/tree/master/data
