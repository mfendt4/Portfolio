The mma math calculator depicts a network of which fighter could beat another fighter based on MMA Math.

Given two fighters names who have never fought, this calculator can "prove" one fighter could beat another.

For example, -If fighter A and fighter C have never fought, -but fighter A has beaten fighter B who has beaten fighter C. -Then, this calculator will print fighter A can beat fighter C. -It will display the following logic in a visual di-graaph: A defeats B who defeats C, therefore, A can defeat C.

Fighter names must be entered with perfect formatting and spelling.
